                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Fraud detection is challenging to implement in real life
                                because it requires cooperation from banks and other companies that are unwilling to
                                share information due to their market competition and legal requirements in protecting
                                user data.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">
                                While we enjoyed working on this project, we could not obtain the goal of 100% in fraud
                                detection, so we got as close as we could with a model we created to get close to our
                                goal with enough time and data. Our project integrates multiple models and their results
                                to increase the final result's accuracy. We trained and evaluated only four predictive
                                models on oversampled SMOTE dataset. Again, we could try training more predictive models
                                on oversampled SMOTE datasets and further improve their performance using Grid Search to
                                tune the model's hyperparameters.
                            </p>

                                Machine Learning analysis faces challenges such as 1) class imbalance; many valid
                                transactions far outnumber fraudulent ones. 2) Also, transaction patterns often change
                                their statistical properties over time. 3) Finally, the algorithms' precision increases
                                when the dataset's size is large. Hence, more data will make the model more accurate in
                                detecting frauds and reducing false positives. However, this requires official support
                                from the companies themselves and users whose data should be protected.

                            <p>We did not know initially that AWS S3 Cloud Server had Data Transfer monthly usage limits. While we were working on the pagination in the Data page, we accessed the data many times and ended up exceeding the monthly data transfer usage limit. We are now keeping a check on the data transfer usage and also try to limit the access.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>While we were trying to improve the model's performance using Hyperparameter tuning, a few parameters in specific models were causing the tuning process to take way too long to execute. Due to time constraints, we had to figure out which parameters were causing the delay in the Hyperparameter tuning process and eliminate them to speed up the process.</p>
