                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This project involves investigating credit card transaction data to develop a machine learning model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions. Our team tried various
                                machine learning classification models on the transaction data to determine the best model that would flag suspicious activity more accurately.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Have you ever pulled up your credit card statement to see transactions you never performed? Or Have you ever used your credit card in a store only to have it declined? One cause for these is that the bank's fraud-detecting technologies
                        have missed to flag suspicious activity or incorrectly flagged a genuine transaction as suspicious.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Credit card fraud is the fastest-growing problem today in the financial market. There has been an accelerated increase in the rate of fraudulent activities in recent years, especially during the COVID time, causing enormous financial
                        losses to many organizations, companies, and government agencies. The fraudulent transaction numbers are assumed to rise in the future.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">According to The Nilson Report, fraud losses worldwide reached $27.85 billion in 2018 and are projected to rise to $35.67 billion in five years and $40.63 billion in 10 years. Recent trends show a steep rise in credit card fraud, which
                        can be costly to consumers, taxpayers, banks, and payment networks that issue refunds to consumers alike.</p>
