                                machine learning classification models on the transaction data to determine the best model that would flag suspicious activity more accurately.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Have you ever pulled up your credit card statement to see transactions you never performed? Or Have you ever used your credit card in a store only to have it declined? One cause for these is that the bank's fraud-detecting technologies
                        have missed to flag suspicious activity or incorrectly flagged a genuine transaction as suspicious.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Credit card fraud is the fastest-growing problem today in the financial market. There has been an accelerated increase in the rate of fraudulent activities in recent years, especially during the COVID time, causing enormous financial
                        losses to many organizations, companies, and government agencies. The fraudulent transaction numbers are assumed to rise in the future.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">According to <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/publication_newsletter_archive_issue.php?issue=1164">The Nilson Report</a>, fraud losses worldwide reached $27.85 billion in 2018 and are projected to rise to $35.67 billion in five years
                        and $40.63 billion in 10 years. Recent trends show a steep rise in credit card fraud, which can be costly to consumers, taxpayers, banks, and payment networks that issue refunds to consumers alike.</p>

                        Q2 2017 until Q3 2020. Reports of credit card fraud increased by 107% from Q1 2019 to Q4 2020, Reports of credit card fraud increased by 107% from Q1 2019 to Q4 2020, increasing by only 28% from Q1 2017 to Q1 2019. This rapid spike
                        in 2020 could be because of the new digital normal and boom in online shopping patterns in customers using credit card payments for grocery shopping and deliveries brought in by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <p class="text-justify mt-5">Credit card fraud has skyrocketed in the last few years, and data analysts have been striving to develop machine learning models that could detect and classify suspicious activities from genuine ones more accurately. To come up with
                        a precise machine learning model for credit card fraud detection has several challenges. Due to the Data Privacy of sensitive payment data, which contains private information about customers and businesses, access to such data
                        is highly restricted, making it very difficult to find a publicly available real-world data set. We could only find a dataset released on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">Kaggle website</a> with 284807
                        transactions, a tiny sliver of data that would sufficiently reflect the magnitude and variety of real-world card payments. This dataset is highly imbalanced, with many genuine credit card transactions compared to the fraudulent
                        ones. Another challenge is the difficulty in detecting fraudulent transactions from genuine ones in the dataset as data is highly skewed.</p>
