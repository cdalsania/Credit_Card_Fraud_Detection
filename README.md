# Project title: Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### Have you ever pulled up your credit card statement to see transactions you never performed? Or Have you ever used your credit card in a store only to have it declined? One cause for these is that the bank's fraud-detecting technologies have missed to flag suspicious activity or incorrectly flagged a genuine transaction as suspicious. Our team tried various machine learning classification models on the credit card transaction data to determine the best model that would flag suspicious activity more accurately, and we are excited to share our research and predictions in the Heroku app: [https://credit-card-fraud-detection-ml.herokuapp.com/](https://credit-card-fraud-detection-ml.herokuapp.com/)
